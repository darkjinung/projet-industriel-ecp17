**Scrum** consists of incremental releases called **Sprints**. A sprint lasts about one to three weeks.

Every **Sprint consists of 4 phases** : plan, build, test and review.

**3 needed roles to run Scrum** 
* Product Owner : define the features needed in the product
* Scrum Master : responsible of the team, ensures that the scrum process is running well
* Team : made of developers, testers and writers

**3 Artifacts of Scrum**
* Product backlog : where product owner lists product features called also stories
* User story : is a way to describe a feature set. Most of the time a story is expressed as : As a XXX, I neeed YYY, So that ZZZ !
Evrery sprint is made of a set of users stories
* Burndown chart : shows the completion of works during the sprint 

**4 Ceremonies**
* Sprint planning : meeting gathering all stakeholders to estimate stories weight and Sprint backlog
* Daily Scrum : team meeting to discuss here what was completed and plans for coming days
* Sprint Review : team demonstrates what was accomplished and discuss about future releases
* Retrospective : done together with Srpint Review to assess what went well and what went wrong, in order to improve for coming sprints
