Hello Guys

Here under a sum up of our discussion on Wednesday November 8th :

The benchmark of **"NLTK & Scikit-learn"** vs **"LingPipe"** reveals that the second is more accurate than the first (cf. bencharm results) one. However, implementation and iteration is simpler with NLTK.

1st decision taken : from now and then implementation will be done in python

2nd decision taken : based on the knowledge gathered so far, we are able to build and MVP (minimal viable product).

The MVP will be composed of 3 functionalities:
1- review classification
2- review polarisation
3- product key features extraction

The next Sprint (number 3) will focus on modelisation of each functionality. Sprint 4 will focus on models integration and deployment. Finaly in Sprint 5 we will edit documentation required for midway review.

In Sprint 3, dispatch of tasks will be :
Yoannis : classification model implementation
Amine B : polarisation model implementation
Amine A : Scrum Master role and polarisation model implementation

Below, a recall of Sprints planning
S3 : from Nov. 9th to Nov. 22nd
S4 : from Nov. 23rd to Dec. 6th
S5 : from Dec. 7th to Dec. 20th

Please amend this minutes on Monday Nov 13th noon (CET). 

I'll push the minutes to github Monday afternoon.

Friendly,

Amine B
