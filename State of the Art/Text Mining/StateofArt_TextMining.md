# Definition
Text mining is defined as the non trivial extraction of hidden, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from (large amount of) textual data.

Text Mining tries to extract meaningful information from natural language text. It can be defined as the process of analyzing text to extract information that is useful for a specific purpose. 

Text mining usually deals with texts whose function is to communicate actual information or opinions, and to trigger information extraction from such text automatically. This is fascinating even if success is only partial.

Text Mining can be applied to various areas : 

> Information Retrieval : Information retrieval is regarded as an extension to document retrieval where the documents that are returned are processed to condense or extract the particular information sought by the user.

> Data Mining : Data mining can be described as looking for patterns in data. It can be more fully characterized as the extraction of hidden, previously unknown, but useful information from data. Data  mining tools can predict behaviors and future trends allowing businesses to make positive, knowledge based  decisions

> Natural Language Processing : NLP is one of the oldest and most challenging problems in the field of artificial intelligence. It is the study of human language so that computers can understand natural languages as humans do. NLP research pursues the vague question of how we understand the meaning of a sentence or a document.  
While words nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives are the building blocks of meaning, it is their correlation to each other within  the structure of a sentence in a document, and within the context of what we already know about the world, that provides the true meaning of a text.

> Information Extraction : Information Extraction is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and/or semi structured machine readable documents. In most cases this activity includes processing human language texts by means of natural language processing (NLP). The recent activities in multimedia document processing like automatic annotation and mining information out of images/audio/video could be seen as information extraction. It involves defining the general form of the information that we are interested in as one or more templates, which are used to guide the extraction process. IE systems greatly depend on the data generated by NLP systems.
