**Methodology : Packages Benchmarking** 

In order to compare packages, we suggest to apply following metrics:

* Ease-of-installation : evaluate how hard is to install the packages and also its dependencies (pay attention to GPU extensions)
* Flexibility : evaluate ability to experiment with different architectures, i.e different types of Neural Networks
* Ease-of-use : quantify speed, effort for data preparation/wrappers, tools to examine models, ability to quickly adjust parameters and improve the predictive performance
* Support of parallel computations (Multiple CPU, Multiple GPU, Cluster) 
* Assistance in choosing hyperparameters : check whether set up can be done per node, per iteration, whether changing parameters can be done before convergence, stop and continue
* Performance : compare packages performance on various datasets, benchmarking should not be restricted to one dataset.
