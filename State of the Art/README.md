**NLP State of Art** was conducted following both theorical and practical approaches

Findings were dispatch on 4 main categories
* Deep and Machine Learnings
* Semantic and Sentiment Analysis
* Text Mining
* Topic Analysis

In each category folder, you'll find a deck that explains main concepts and most known frameworks.

From experimentation standpoint, we did experiment various frameworks, each of which, belongs to a given language (Java, Pyhon, R). Below, a summary of capabilities:

</p>
 
**Pyhon:**
* NLTK  : suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing for English written in the Python programming language.
* Scikit Learn :  machine learning library, features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.
* Gensin : library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora. Target audience is the NLP and IR community.

**Java:**
* LinhPipe : toolkit for processing text using computational linguistics
* OpenNLP :  machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text
* StanfordNLP : set of NLP tools. From text input, gives the base forms of words, their parts of speech, whether they are names of companies, people, etc

**R:**
* OpenNLP : wrapper of OpenNLP in R
* TopicModels/TidyText : interface to the C code for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models and Correlated Topics Models (CTM)
* MXNETR : open-source deep learning framework used to train, and deploy deep neural networks
